# bPhone

Short for Browser Phone, is a project that is basically an interface to the Twilio API. I grew tired of expensive solution with lots of features that I didnâ€™t care about. After being unable to find the right solution for the right price. I decide to write some code that is more of a working back-end then a good looking UI.

I wanted something to help me with apps and websites that needed a working phone number.

I personally donâ€™t own a SIM card, nor I car to get one. The world is moving forward, and to unstuck me from the present I created bPhone to present Iâ€™m still in the dar ages of technology ;)

# The project

â€¦ is designed to be hosted by yourself on Heroku, thus the Heroku Button on the bottom. You click it, follow the instructions, and you have your own interface to the Twilio API.

To make it work of course youâ€™ll need a Twilio account and money on that account. bPhone will display your numbers and messages.

Of course you donâ€™t have to host this code on Heroku, you can grab the project and throw it on anything, but right now the Heroku Button is the easiest way to start.
