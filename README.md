# bPhone

Short for Browser Phone, bPhone is a project that is basically an interface to the Twilio API. I grew tired of expensive solutions with lots of features that I didnâ€™t care about. I wanted something basic that just does one thing: Send and receive SMS. After being unable to find the right solution for the right price, I decided to write some code that is more of a working backend than an attractive UI.

I basically wanted something to help me register on old fashioned sites that require a phone to create an account.

I personally donâ€™t own a SIM card, nor do I care to get one. The world is moving forward, and to get unstuck from the present, I created bPhone to move myself into the future. ;)

# The project

â€¦is designed to be hosted by yourself on Heroku, thus the Heroku Button on the bottom. You click it, follow the instructions, and you have your own interface for the Twilio API.

Of course, to make bPhone work, youâ€™ll need a [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com), as well as money in that account.

To buy a phone number, you can just use the bPhone page; youâ€™ll get a random number with SMS capabilities from the selected country. Unless the country is weird...then oh, well...try to move to another place! ;)

# Hosting

Of course, you donâ€™t have to host this code on Heroku; you can grab the project and throw it on anything, but right now the Heroku Button is the easiest way to start.
